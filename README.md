# Audio Translator using OpenAI's Whisper

This repository documents my exploration of OpenAI's Whisper, an advanced speech-to-text model, through a hands-on experiment with a German audio clip from the movie "Inglourious Basterds". Whisper is known for its robust performance across multiple languages and accents, making it an ideal candidate for testing its transcription capabilities and understanding of nuanced language.
